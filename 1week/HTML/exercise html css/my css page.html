    <h1>Welcome To Disney Land</h1>
    <p>
      Disneyland Paris is an entertainment resort in Chessy, France, 32 kilometres (20 miles) east of Paris. It encompasses two theme parks, resort hotels, Nature Resorts, a shopping, dining and entertainment complex, and a golf course. Disneyland Park is the original theme park of the complex, opening in 1992. A second theme park, Walt Disney Studios Park, opened in 2002. Disneyland Paris celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2022; by then 375 million people had visited, making it the most visited theme park in Europe.[1][2] It is the second Disney park outside the United States, following the opening of the Tokyo Disney Resort in 1983, and the largest. Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by The Walt Disney Company. It includes seven hotels: Santa Fe, Hotel Cheyenne, Sequoia Lodge, Newport Bay Club, Hotel New York â€“ the Art of Marvel, The Disneyland Hotel, and Davy Crockett Ranch.
